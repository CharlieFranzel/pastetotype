# Text To Type

Welcome to **Text To Type**, a simple Python application designed to take inputted text and type it out at a given speed. The main purpose of this tool is to mimic natural typing, making it appear as though work is being done slowly or to avoid showing copied work in revision histories of certain applications.

---

## ‚ö° Features
- **Customizable Typing Speed**: Set the typing speed to simulate natural typing.
- **Simple Input Mechanism**: Provide the text and let the application do the rest.
- **Lightweight**: A very basic application, easy to use and understand.

---

## üìã How It Works
1. Input the text you want to type.
2. Specify the typing speed (in characters per second or delay per character).
3. Run the program, and the application will simulate typing the text in the desired application window (e.g., a document editor or text box).

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
- **Python**: The only language I know (so far).

## üéØ Purpose
This project was created for:
- Personal learning as I explore Python development.
- Practical use for anyone needing to simulate slow typing for specific applications.

> **Disclaimer**: This is a very amateur application made by an amateur developer. Use it responsibly and only in appropriate contexts.
